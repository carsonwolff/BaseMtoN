Hello, and welcome to my first coding project!
This project was inspired by my Discrete Mathematics class where we discussed number theory.
Please try it as you please and let me know if there are any issues!
If you would like to run the file you can download the .class file and run it in your terminal:
 1. Navigate to the correct directoy
 1a. Windows: In the terminal use dir and cd to navigate to the Downloads (usually done through typing "cd Downloads"), use dir to check that you are in the right place.
1b. Mac OS: Use pwd, ls, and cd to Navigate to the Downloads, use ls to check.
2. Type "java BaseMtoN" to run!
